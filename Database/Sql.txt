second highest salary
select max(salary) from employee where salary < (select max(salary) from employee)

inner table

get name who got incentive
select name from employee where id in (select id from incentive_table);
---------outer table------------       ------inner table------------

inner most table

get name which females ('F') got incentives

select name from employee where id in (select id from incentive_table where id in(select id from status where gender='F'))
---------outer table------------       ------------------inner table------------   --------inner most table--------------


---data types---

int for id
varchar name,email etc
Enum
birth_date Dat
gender Enum('F','M')


---constrains----
NOT NULL----name,phone,date_of_birth
Unique----> phone
primary key--->id
foreign key---it is used build relation between 2 tables and it consist repetitive values
Enum--->gender
set---->store more than one values

ex: 

foreign key-----------

//Main table

use db;
create table Student(
id int primary key,
name varchar(20) NOT NULL,
gender enum('F','M'),
certificate set('J2ee','Devops','Spring boot')
);

insert into student values(103,'Ruhi','F','Spring boot');

select * from student;

//attendance

create table attendance (
empid int,
attendance_date Date,
class int
)

//sub-table
create table attendance (
id int,
attendance_date Date,
class int
);

select * from attendance;

insert into attendance values (1,'2025-3-20',1);

select name from student where id IN (select id from attendance);



------------------------------------------------------------
subtract 2 table  and give me output?

using above table
//IN --->will give matching record
//NOT--->IN will give non matching record
select id from student where id NOT IN (select id from attendance);

----------------------------------------------------------------------

joins ------> which will give combination of 2 or more tables and displaying table

     t1           t2
ex: A B C         ADEF    

i want A E table then we will use joins


INNER JOIN-------
display name from student table and attendance from attendance table

select   student.name,  attendance.attendance_date from  student    inner join  attendance on  student.id=attendance.id
       --student table--  ----attendance table----      -main table--                          --main table id = sub table id--      


LEFT JOIN ------- is used to retrieve all records from the left table and the matching records from the right table. If there is no match in the right table, NULL values are returned for the right table’s columns.

select student.name ,student.gender , attendance.class from student left join attendance ON student.id=attendance.id


RIGHT JOIN ------- retrieves all records from the right table and the matching records from the left table. If there is no match in the left table, NULL values are returned for the left table’s columns.

select student.name ,student.gender , attendance.class from student right join attendance ON student.id=attendance.id

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Difference Between INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and RIGHT JOIN in MySQL
1. INNER JOIN
✅ Returns only matching records from both tables.
❌ If there is no match, the row is excluded.

2. LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN)
✅ Returns all records from the left table and matching records from the right table.
❌ If no match is found, NULL values are returned from the right table.

3. RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN)
✅ Returns all records from the right table and matching records from the left table.
❌ If no match is found, NULL values are returned from the left table.
